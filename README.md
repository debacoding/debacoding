## Personal Imp. Points:
0. Include this line in main() for fast I/O operations:
```cpp
std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
```
1. after sorting an array elements, first element becomes smallest and last becomes largest
2. for rotation of an array by D elements :
```cpp
if(D>N)
D %= N;
// For left rotate-
arr[i] = arr[(i+D)%N]
// For right rotate-
arr[i] = arr[(i+N-D)%N]
```
